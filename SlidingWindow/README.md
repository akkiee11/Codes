# Sliding Window Pattern

## Introduction
The Sliding Window pattern is a computational technique that aims to reduce the use of nested loops in algorithms. It converts two nested loops into a single loop, reducing time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n). This pattern is particularly useful for solving problems that involve arrays, strings, or linked lists where we need to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays or sublists of a given size.

## When to Use Sliding Window?
- When dealing with contiguous sequence of elements (subarrays, substrings)
- When tracking a subset of elements in an array/string
- When the size of the window is fixed or variable based on certain conditions
- When needing to calculate something among all possible subarrays/substrings

## Types of Sliding Window
1. **Fixed Window Size**
   - Window size remains constant throughout
   - Example: Find maximum sum subarray of size k

2. **Variable Window Size**
   - Window size changes based on conditions
   - Example: Longest substring with k distinct characters

## Common Patterns
1. Initialize window pointers (start, end)
2. Expand window by moving end pointer
3. Process current window
4. Contract window by moving start pointer when needed
5. Update result based on window content

## Time Complexity Analysis
- Most sliding window solutions run in O(n) time complexity
- Space complexity typically O(1) for fixed window size
- Space complexity can be O(k) for problems tracking k distinct elements

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Not handling edge cases (empty array/string)
2. Incorrect window size calculations
3. Forgetting to update window state when sliding
4. Not resetting window state when needed
5. Incorrect handling of window boundaries

## Tips for Solving Sliding Window Problems
1. Identify if the problem fits sliding window pattern
2. Determine if window size is fixed or variable
3. Choose appropriate data structure for window state
4. Handle edge cases first
5. Test with various input sizes and patterns
